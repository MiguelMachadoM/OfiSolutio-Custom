Minimal sale unit restriction
=============================

This module restricts sales to only allow a minimum quantity to sale. This is
called Minimal Sale Unit (MSU). you will also be only allowed to sale multiples
of this quantity.

There's also the possibility to have a second unit, a minimum sale special
unit, that allows to order less quantity than the MSU, but increase the price a
10%.
